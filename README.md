#  Sonos Menu Controller

The Sonos Menu Controller enables macOS users to do basic controls of their Sonos devices right from their menu bar.
It's possible to change volume, pause, or change to the next/previous track.

## Story
I recently bought my first Sonos system. I really like a lot of features about Sonos and I came across some issues, which haven't been covered by the Sonos App.
I started listening to music from my iPhone with the Sonos app, but when I was sitting on my Mac working I wasn't able to change the volume quickly or pause a track.
The cool thing is the Sonos system is super easy to control and very open. So I decided to make this small tool to help me in those situations.
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do and if you find any missing features / issues. Just create an issue on this page.
